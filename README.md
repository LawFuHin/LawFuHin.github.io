## Detail Introduction

Hi, I'm William Law, a junior web developer with a passion for building innovative solutions. I have a solid foundation in full stack web development, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals.

I completed a 6-month full-stack web bootcamp at Xceelerate and have a BEng (Hons) in Industrial and Systems Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I completed several iconic projects that mostly received grade A.

I recently completed a Full-Stack Development Immersive Bootcamp, where I learned front-end, back-end, and React.js for the whole full-stack development.I completed four main projects, each demonstrating my skills and creativity. These projects include "About Me," "Project Canvas," "Cantonese Study Ease," and "Speed." You can find more details about these projects on my portfolio website.

During my studies, I joined TTM Technologies as an Engineering Intern and won the Second-class Scholarship at the 2021 IPC Asia Scholar Program. Vincent, the chief engineer, praised my detail-oriented approach and ability to absorb new knowledge quickly. I worked at TTM Technologies from 06/2021 - 08/2021 and returned to PolyU for my final two semesters.

After completing my studies, I was offered a role as a Technical Engineer at TTM Technologies from 02/2022 - 08/2022. In this position, I was responsible for a wide range of duties, including serving as a Technical Query Team Member for Big Tech's quick-turn (QTA) services, attending Design For Manufacturing (DFM) meetings, performing PCB Gerber manufacturing capability reviews, developing automation tools using Python and VBA, and conducting data analysis using Minitab for design of experiment (DOE).

I'm currently seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional context. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out at +(852) 6489 4416 or lawfuhin@gmail.com. You can also find me on LinkedIn at William-Law-998325247 and on GitHub at github.com/LawFuHin. I look forward to hearing from you!.
